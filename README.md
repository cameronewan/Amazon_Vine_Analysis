-0.98%


## Summary:
According to the results of our analysis there does not appear to be any bias due to that fact that both Vine and Non-Vine members gave 5 stars rating less than 1% of the time. There was not a statistical significance so we can determine that there is no bias. One thing we might want to take into consideration is the sample size of the data. We have a lot more reviews for Non-Vine users than we do for Vine users which means means that the vine user data may not be as reliable as we might like. The more data you have the more accurately it will represent the population. However, one interesting thing to consider is that amazon vine user are invited by amazon based on the accuracy and usefulness of their reviews, which might suggest that we can trust their data with a smaller sample size becuase they are considered a trusted source.
